# My Addiction Of Catppuccin

## Why Catppuccin

Catppuccin, from a vscode theme became my everything's color scheme. Catppuccin is, I quoted from their github profile, "Soothing pastel theme for the high-spirited!" Yes, it has github profile, and the hundreds of repos are amazing! This is the first time I found out there's theme that isn't just a theme.

They not only have all those ports, but also design guidelines and it's MIT licensed. That changes everything. That means I really can use it for everything. As you can see below, I have it for my hyprland rice, still my vscode, and even my websites.

## Catppuccin Userstyles

This is one of those things that I learned after knowing catppuccin. How great it is to have even my frequently used website to be catppuccin themed.

I immediately installed Stylus on my browser of choice, at the time firefox. 

## Daisyui

Daisyui is a tailwindcss ui library that I always use for my personal projects.

Although there's a catppuccin daisyui port exist I decided to make a custom one using their theme generator.

Not only I can customize the color scheme, I can also set all the visual bits.

## Mocha and Latte

For dark theme, which is my original purpose for finding theme, I always use mocha. That is what you see on my screenshots. Mocha is the darkest of the catppuccin palettes.
But, I do need Light theme. It is especially for my websites where others might use. Luckily catppuccin has latte. A nice pastel light theme that doesn't hurt my eyes.
